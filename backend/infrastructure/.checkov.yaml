  # CKV_AWS_18: Ensure the S3 bucket has access logging enabled
  # Justification: The CloudFrontAccessLogsBucket is the designated destination
  # for CloudFront access logs. Enabling access logging on the logs bucket itself
  # would create circular/infinite logging, which is an anti-pattern.

  # CKV_AWS_68: CloudFront Distribution should have WAF enabled
  # Justification: This is a read-only static website served from S3 with no
  # dynamic content, APIs, user input, or server-side processing. WAF provides
  # minimal security benefit for static content while adding unnecessary cost.
  # CloudFront includes AWS Shield Standard for DDoS protection.
